# TriviaGame
In this game, the user is presented one question at a time. 
Each question is timed for 30 seconds.
After each answer, the user will see the correct answer, and the next question will appear in a few seconds without any user input.
If the user fails to answer in the allotted time, the correct answer will be displayed, and the next question will appear after a few seconds.
Once all questions have been answered, the user's results will be displayed, with the option to reset the game.
